# My Repository

Hi, This is the github repo for my Navertica test. 

I used trusted php for the test 

Test: 

You can use programming language according to your wish. Specification:

Print numbers from 1 to 100. For numbers that are a multiple of 3, print the text "NAV" instead of the number, for multiples of 5, print "ERTICA". For numbers that are multiples of 3 and 5, print "NAVERTICA" instead of the number.
